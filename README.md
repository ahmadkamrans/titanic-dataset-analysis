# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## **Overview**
- The **Titanic Dataset** contains the detailed information about the passenger's aboard on it, which sank during its first commute on **April 15, 1912**. After colliding with the **ice-berg**. 
- The primary objective of analyzing this dataset is to extract some useful insights for the passenger survival on vairous features.

#### **Columns**
The dataset includes the following columns:

- **PassengerId:** A unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived:** Indicated if the passenger suvived (1) or, not (0)
- **Pclass:** Ticket Class for the passengers aboard (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name:** Passenger's full name
- **Sex:** Gende of the passenger
- **Age:** Age of the passenger
- **Sibsp:** Number of sibling, spouses
- **Parch:** Number of Parents, children
- **Ticket:** Ticket Number
- **Fare:** Passenger fare
- **Cabin:** Cabin number (some are mentioned in dataset in series like B1-B10)
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C for Cherbourg, Q for Queenstown, S for       Southhampon)

## Cleaning of Dataset

As now we have a basic knowledge of what dataset is about, and on which columns the whole dataset is comprised of. Let's start cleaning the dataset: 

- Our dataset is comprised of 11 columns with total 891 entries for each column.

- Now let's see the columns where the entries are not 891. But instead they have missing/null values in those columns. The findings were: 
 - Age, Cabin, and Embarked entries were missing

![alt text](images/image%201.png)

- Count of the missing values in the mentioned columns above:
  1. Age has 177 missing entries
  2. Cabin has 687 missing entries
  3. Embarked has 2 missing entries

#### Identified Columns cleaning

Now as till now we have identified the problematic columns lets proceed with cleaning of the one by one.

##### AGE: 
- As the age column has numerical data. A better insight into it is by using the describe which will give us the mean, median, max, quartiles for the box plot. 

![alt text](images/image%203.png)

- The median age is 28 years

![alt text](images/image%204.png)

- Before deciding anything let's plot a simple histogram to see what the age distribution looks like on raw data.

![alt text](images/image%205.png) 

 Here we can see that the our data is not either **skewed** to the left, or right. But close to **symmetrical**. Making a good balanced mountain hill. If you try to make it by drawing the a one line through all the bars on there top. 
 On **raw data** before cleaning, the most high age count in result of the distribution is between **late 20's to 30**.

-  Now there are two approaches to go with:
   1. If the skewness value is:
      - greater than 1
      - less than -1
    then simply replace the missing/null values with the **mean**
   2. If skewness value is:
      - close to zero 
    then simply replace the missing/null values with **median**

- In our case, we decided to go with the mean. As, out skewness value is:

 Thi case the value was close to zero, meaning symmetrical. So, we replaced the missing values with mean resulting in this histogram:

##### Insights of the AGE: 
1. **Peak at 30 Years:** 
    - We can see the highest bar is around the **30 years**. Which aligns with the **mean (29.7)** used for missing data imputations.
    - THe large spike here is showing a lage number of missing values were replaced with the mean. 
2. **Distribution Shape:**
    - The distribution shape is suggesting that as the a large number of passengers were between (**20-40**) years. With a smaller count for (**0-10**) years, and (**60+**) years. 

##### Cabin: 

So, our cabin columns has categorical data which has cabin numbers in series. And, this column has the largest number of the missing values. For, a more better insight let's do a value count on it to have the idea how many cabins per series are assigned: 

![alt text](images/image%208.png)

So, here if we see the percentage, so it turns out to be that **77 percent** of the entries were missing/NA. So, i replaced them with **'Unknown'** values in the column.

##### Emarked:

Similarly, embarked column also has categorical data. And, for it there is a simple approach to replace it with **'unknown'**.

## Visualization

As the dataset is cleaned. Let's proceed with cleaning of the dataset. Now, we will visualize it using **matplotlib.plt**:

- **Gender Distribution:** 

So, this is the distribution of all the genders we are seeign through the bar chart.

1. **More Males than Females:**  The male count (**577**) is significantely higher than the female count (**314**). Showing that the large proportion of passengers were male. In future visualization's you will see how it will affect the survival rates.

2. **Gender Survvial:** The titanic evacuation followed a "women and childern first" policy. Since females were fewer in number, and being evcuated first there survival rate is higher as compared to males.

Now through bar chart the survived, and dead analysis based on males, and females:

![alt text](images/image%2014.png)

**2.1: Females Had a Higher Survival Rate:** A large number of females survived as there is significant **large pink bar**. A small blue bar as compared to males. Only a small number of males survived. This confirms the females, and children evacuation first policy.

**2.2: Males Has a Lower Survival Rate:** A small number of males survived as the **pink bar** is quite **small** compared to the females ones. Depicting a larger blue bar which shows dead case.

**2.3 Males vs Female Survival Ratio:**
- **79.9%** of survivors were female, while only **20.3%** were male. 
- This reinfornces the strong "women and children first" policy, as women had a higher chance of survival.

![alt text](images/image%2015.png)

**2.4 Males vs Female Not Survived Ratio:**
- **79.9%** of the non-survivors were male, while **24.1%** were female.
- The majority of males did not survive.
