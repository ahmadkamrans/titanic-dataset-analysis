# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## **Overview**
- The **Titanic Dataset** contains the detailed information about the passenger's aboard on it, which sank during its first commute on **April 15, 1912**. After colliding with the **ice-berg**. 
- The primary objective of analyzing this dataset is to extract some useful insights for the passenger survival on vairous features.

#### **Columns**
The dataset includes the following columns:

- **PassengerId:** A unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived:** Indicated if the passenger suvived (1) or, not (0)
- **Pclass:** Ticket Class for the passengers aboard (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name:** Passenger's full name
- **Sex:** Gende of the passenger
- **Age:** Age of the passenger
- **Sibsp:** Number of sibling, spouses
- **Parch:** Number of Parents, children
- **Ticket:** Ticket Number
- **Fare:** Passenger fare
- **Cabin:** Cabin number (some are mentioned in dataset in series like B1-B10)
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C for Cherbourg, Q for Queenstown, S for       Southhampon)

## Cleaning of Dataset

As now we have a basic knowledge of what dataset is about, and on which columns the whole dataset is comprised of. Let's start cleaning the dataset: 

- Our dataset is comprised of 11 columns with total 891 entries for each column.

- Now let's see the columns where the entries are not 891. But instead they have missing/null values in those columns. The findings were: 
 - Age, Cabin, and Embarked entries were missing

- Count of the missing values in the mentioned columns above:
  1. Age has 177 missing entries
  2. Cabin has 687 missing entries
  3. Embarked has 2 missing entries

#### Identified Columns cleaning

Now as till now we have identified the problematic columns lets proceed with cleaning of the one by one.

##### AGE: 
- As the age column has numerical data. A better insight into it is by using the describe which will give us the mean, median, max, quartiles for the box plot.

- The median age is 28 years

- Before deciding anything let's plot a simple histogram to see what the age distribution looks like on raw data.

 Here we can see that the our data is not either skewed to the left, or right. But close to symmetrical. Making a good balanced mountain hill. If you try to make it by drawing the a one line through all the bars on there top. 
 On raw data before cleaning, the most high distributed age is between late 20's to 30.
