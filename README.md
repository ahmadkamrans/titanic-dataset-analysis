# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## **Overview**
- The **Titanic Dataset** contains the detailed information about the passenger's aboard on it, which sank during its first commute on **April 15, 1912**. After colliding with the **ice-berg**. 
- The primary objective of analyzing this dataset is to extract some useful insights for the passenger survival on vairous features.

#### **Columns**
The dataset includes the following columns:

- **PassengerId:** A unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived:** Indicated if the passenger suvived (1) or, not (0)
- **Pclass:** Ticket Class for the passengers aboard (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name:** Passenger's full name
- **Sex:** Gende of the passenger
- **Age:** Age of the passenger
- **Sibsp:** Number of sibling, spouses
- **Parch:** Number of Parents, children
- **Ticket:** Ticket Number
- **Fare:** Passenger fare
- **Cabin:** Cabin number (some are mentioned in dataset in series like B1-B10)
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C for Cherbourg, Q for Queenstown, S for       Southhampon)

## Cleaning of Dataset

As now we have a basic knowledge of what dataset is about, and on which columns the whole dataset is comprised of. Let's start cleaning the dataset: 

- Our dataset is comprised of 11 columns with total 891 entries for each column.

- Now let's see the columns where the entries are not 891. But instead they have missing/null values in those columns. The findings were: 
 - Age, Cabin, and Embarked entries were missing

![alt text](images/image%201.png)

- Count of the missing values in the mentioned columns above:
  1. Age has 177 missing entries
  2. Cabin has 687 missing entries
  3. Embarked has 2 missing entries

#### Identified Columns cleaning

Now as till now we have identified the problematic columns lets proceed with cleaning of the one by one.

##### AGE: 
- As the age column has numerical data. A better insight into it is by using the describe which will give us the mean, median, max, quartiles for the box plot. 

![alt text](images/image%203.png)

- The median age is 28 years

![alt text](images/image%204.png)

- Before deciding anything let's plot a simple histogram to see what the age distribution looks like on raw data.

![alt text](images/image%205.png) 

 Here we can see that the our data is not either **skewed** to the left, or right. But close to **symmetrical**. Making a good balanced mountain hill. If you try to make it by drawing the a one line through all the bars on there top. 
 On **raw data** before cleaning, the most high age count in result of the distribution is between **late 20's to 30**.

-  Now there are two approaches to go with:
   1. If the skewness value is:
      - greater than 1
      - less than -1
    then simply replace the missing/null values with the **mean**
   2. If skewness value is:
      - close to zero 
    then simply replace the missing/null values with **median**

- In our case, we decided to go with the mean. As, out skewness value is: 

![alt text](images/image%206.png)  

 Thi case the value was close to zero, meaning symmetrical. So, we replaced the missing values with mean resulting in this histogram: 

![alt text](images/image%207.png)

##### Insights of the AGE: 
1. **Peak at 30 Years:** 
    - We can see the highest bar is around the **30 years**. Which aligns with the **mean (29.7)** used for missing data imputations.
    - THe large spike here is showing a lage number of missing values were replaced with the mean. 
2. **Distribution Shape:**
    - The distribution shape is suggesting that as the a large number of passengers were between (**20-40**) years. With a smaller count for (**0-10**) years, and (**60+**) years. 

##### Cabin: 

So, our cabin columns has categorical data which has cabin numbers in series. And, this column has the largest number of the missing values. For, a more better insight let's do a value count on it to have the idea how many cabins per series are assigned: 

![alt text](images/image%208.png)

So, here if we see the percentage, so it turns out to be that **77 percent** of the entries were missing/NA. So, i replaced them with **'Unknown'** values in the column. 

![alt text](images/image%2010.png)

##### Emarked:

Similarly, embarked column also has categorical data. And, for it there is a simple approach to replace it with **'unknown'**.

## Visualization

As the dataset is cleaned. Let's proceed with cleaning of the dataset. Now, we will visualize it using **matplotlib.plt**:

- **Gender Distribution:** 

So, this is the distribution of all the genders we are seeign through the bar chart.

1. **More Males than Females:**  The male count (**577**) is significantely higher than the female count (**314**). Showing that the large proportion of passengers were male. In future visualization's you will see how it will affect the survival rates.

![alt text](images/image%2012.png)

2. **Gender Survvial:** The titanic evacuation followed a "women and childern first" policy. Since females were fewer in number, and being evcuated first there survival rate is higher as compared to males. 

![alt text](images/image%2013.png)

Now through bar chart the survived, and dead analysis based on males, and females:

![alt text](images/image%2014.png)

**2.1: Females Had a Higher Survival Rate:** A large number of females survived as there is significant **large pink bar**. A small blue bar as compared to males. Only a small number of males survived. This confirms the females, and children evacuation first policy.

**2.2: Males Has a Lower Survival Rate:** A small number of males survived as the **pink bar** is quite **small** compared to the females ones. Depicting a larger blue bar which shows dead case.

**2.3 Males vs Female Survival Ratio:**
- **79.9%** of survivors were female, while only **20.3%** were male. 
- This reinfornces the strong "women and children first" policy, as women had a higher chance of survival.

![alt text](images/image%2015.png)

**2.4 Males vs Female Not Survived Ratio:**
- **79.9%** of the non-survivors were male, while **24.1%** were female.
- The majority of males did not survive. 

![alt text](images/image%2016.png)

**2.5 Categorizing the Age:**
So, here in the dataset are the ages are in float format. But there is no characterization of the child, adult e.t.c. So, for a better insight of the age I binned it as: 

```python
bins = [0, 12, 18, 30, 50, 80]
labels = ['Child', 'Teen', 'Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Senior']
```
![alt text](images/image%2017.png)

- **148** survivors were in the "Young Adult (**18-25**)" group, making it the largest surviving age group.
- This could be due there better physical fitness, ability to reach life boats.
- **102** were the survivors from the "Adult" group, indicating the middle-aged passengers also had a fair chance of survival. 
- **40** children survived despite the "women, children first policy" but might be possible that children would have separated from there families during rescue.
- **22** senior survived, howing that older passengers had the least chance of survival due to slower response time, or lack f prioritization.
- **30** only thirty teens survived.

Similary, these are the stats for the age group that not survived:

![alt text](images/image%2018.png)

- **299** young adults lost their life
- **139** adult lost ther life 
- **29** children did not survive, but this number is lower than young adults and adults.
- **30** teens did not survive, suggesting they were not prioritized like younger children.
- **22** seniors perished, but this doesnâ€™t mean they had a high survival rate.

**2.6: Age Group Survival Percentage:**
- Here you can see the young adults have higher survivor rate (**18-35 years**)
- A significant 29.8% of the survivors were adults (**25-55 years old**). Middle age individuals were still able to survvie at a reasonable rate.
- Despite the "women, and children first policy", only **11.7%** of the survivors were children. 
- Teen (**13-17**) made up just 8.8% of the survivors.

3. **Gender-Wise Embarkment:**

``` python
gender_wise_port_pickup = df.groupby('Sex')['Embarked'].value_counts()

gender_wise_port_pickup
```

First, I extracted that how many males, and females were pickeup from all of three ports, and the unkown port.

![alt text](images/image%2020.png)

After that I extracted for individual gender how many females, survived that were picked up from different embarkments:

```python
female_survived_embarked= female_survived.groupby('Embarked').size()
female_survived_embarked
```

![alt text](images/image%2021.png)

![alt text](images/image%2022.png)

- Southampton (S) had the highest female survival count (140).
- Cherbourg (C) had a moderate survival count (63).
- Queenstown (Q) had a much lower survival count (30).
- Very few females survived from "Unknown Port".
- This suggests women from Southampton had better chances of survival.


Now, I will extract the male embarkment through different ports

```python
male_survived_embarked = male_survived.groupby('Embarked').size()
male_survived_embarked
```

![alt text](images/image%2023.png)

![alt text](images/image%2024.png)

- Southampton (S) had the highest male survival count (75).
- Cherbourg (C) had a lower survival count (30).
- Queenstown (Q) had an even lower survival count (5).
- This aligns with previous findings: males had a much lower survival rate regardless of embarkation point.

4. **Fare Distribution Passenger Class wise on Embarkment:**

![alt text](images/image%2025.png)

- **Cherbourg (C) Passengers Paid Higher Fares on Average**

The median fare for Cherbourg (C) is significantly higher than for Southampton (S) and Queenstown (Q).
Several extreme outliers exceed 500, indicating wealthy first-class passengers.
This aligns with previous findings that Cherbourg passengers had higher survival rates, likely due to a higher proportion of first-class travelers.

- **Queenstown (Q) Passengers Paid the Lowest Fares**

The median fare for Queenstown is the lowest, suggesting that most passengers from this port were third-class travelers.
There are very few high-paying outliers, reinforcing that wealthier passengers were uncommon here.
This supports previous insights where Queenstown passengers had lower survival rates, likely due to being mostly third-class.

- **Southampton (S) Passengers Had a Wide Fare Range**

Southampton had many low and moderate fare values but also some higher fares, suggesting a mix of passenger classes.
There are many outliers, but the highest fare is below that of Cherbourgâ€™s top outliers.
